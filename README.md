# Notes

For building this UI, I opted for React and Material UI. I also decided to set up the React project manually (instead of using `create-react-app`) in order to gain some more familiarity with Webpack.

Since it's such a small project, I decided against Redux or any other state management tools. 

I also added a searchbar, which is implemented with a trie.


A few outstanding issues:
* Making a search will reset any sorting and restore any deleted albums. Since the search function is just a little extra anyway, I didn't prioritize it, but if I were going to fix the issue I would use some centralized state management to make updating the album list and search trie simpler.
* The styling could be improved. It's a bit lackluster as it is, and the album covers aren't perfectly cropped.
* Not suited for smaller screen sizes
* The Tooltip component triggers a nasty deprecation error in the console. I wasn't able to find a satisfactory solution, but it doesn't affect the functionality at all.
* The `webpack.dev.js` file should have an accompanying `webpack.prod.js` file for building for production.






## Music Library UI Assessment ðŸŽµ

Given the albums.json, create a simple UI that can do the following
1. Display the albums as a list of UI components. Each component should render the album artwork image, title, and artist.
2. Add a sort component that allows the user to sort the albums by artist name or album name.
3. Remove albums.
4. The `alt` property for each `<img>` tag should be set to the parsed out filename from the url. For example:  "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a6/Souvlaki_%28album%29_cover.jpg" should render as `<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a6/Souvlaki_%28album%29_cover.jpg" alt="Souvlaki_%28album%29_cover.jpg" />`


A mock-up has been included to provide visual guidance. Your UI does not have to perfectly match the mock-up.

This exercise should not take more than a few hours. It's okay to get creative but don't stress yourself out!
